    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Soufyan, and Iâ€™m passionate about game development, web design, psychology, and art.
    Iâ€™m currently a student at <i>Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam</i> and I love creating interactive, engaging websites for people. 
    When I'm not working on projects, I enjoy gaming with friends and listening to music.</p>

    <h2>My Journey</h2>
    <p>I started my journey in Roblox Studio when I was 14, and since then, I've been exploring new ways to bring my ideas to life. 
    Iâ€™ve worked on a magic PVP/RPG game called 'Incantus Sorcerers' and am always looking for new challenges to grow my skills.</p>
